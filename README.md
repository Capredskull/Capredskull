## Hi there! 👋

I’m Samyog, a software engineer from Germany, powered by caffeine, mild panic, and bad decisions made at 2 a.m.
I’ve been coding since 2020 — long enough to know that “efficient and effective” often just means "barely held together but nobody’s screaming."
Most of my code is private — not because it’s top secret, but because I am afraid engineers over at openAI will sue for trying to sabotage their AI with my code.

## About Me

Occasionally, I remember GitHub exists — usually when I stumble upon my lazygit config in the shell. I push a few commits, tell myself I’m being productive, and then forget it exists again.
The truth? Most of my work lives on my devices, patiently waiting to disappear the moment I format my drives.

My professor during my bachelor’s once told me: "You’ll never make a good engineer if you don’t learn how to be lazy." — I took that to heart.

But if you’ve got something interesting, weird, or exciting, and you need someone to git push at 3 a.m. while surviving on coffee and spite — you’re in the right place.

Hit me up on email and we’ll talk.
